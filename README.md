# NullMVC-JS-base
 pulling out the javascript mvc stuff into it's own repo. like the main mvc-base repo this is kinda a backup where i'm going to try to pull out the most recent version of this from whatever project i've been working on and strip out all the specifics for the project so i can maybe update this in other projects.
